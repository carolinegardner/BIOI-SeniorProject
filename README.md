## How Regional Diversity Affects the Plant Microbiome

Human health has long been the focus of society and the media. Health is directly influenced by the gut biome, which in turn is affected by the quality of ingested food. Alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomic classification were performed in order to generate information about the richness and diversity of soil and farm crop samples. Data from Asia and North America was compared to determine which region had greater diversity. Analysis of these results showed that in the majority of the comparisons, Asia had a higher community richness score and greater diversity as a whole. This backs up the theory that Asia produces healthier food as a region.

### Code Requirements:

In order to replicate or run any of the code described here the user must have a conda environment installed as well as Qiime2. Requirements for package installation will vary per device. 


### Data: 

Description and location of all sequences used in this project can be found in the Project_Data folder. The raw sequences were too large to store on GitHub.


### Code:

A full file of all commands used in this project can be found under the Code_Commands folder. This commands can be edited to run for many different files. Not all of the code produced meaningful results. The Metadata file contains metadata for soil, apple and corn respectively. These files are needed in order to run some of the commands. 


### Results:

The results folder contains a list of all relevant alpha and beta diversity results produced as well as a subfolder containing all visuals deemed signficant that are used in the paper/presentation.
